    For this assignment, I chose to do "Form control file input".
    This can be very useful for submitting documents, music, pictures, or even videos.
    It reminds me of how Youtube works, or when you submit a resume, or fill out an online application.
    I'm pretty sure this implement would need some sort of JavaScript to do things like check for a certain file format, or making sure the file being submitted isn't over a certain size.
    Uploading media onto a platform would render this tool necessary, as it is a way of posting from locally, onto the web.
    An example would be when you need to verify your identity online, and are asked to provide a picture of your Drivers License or any other requested form of identification.
    This tool is very important, and we come across it many times in many ways.
    I have to upload MP3 files onto my beatstars account this way.
